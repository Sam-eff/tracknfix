## Local Docker Modes

TracknFix now has two separate local Docker workflows:

- `http://localhost/`
  This is the production-like Docker stack from [docker-compose.yml](/Users/samuel/Documents/Techshopmananger/docker-compose.yml). Frontend changes require a rebuild because Nginx serves a built bundle.

- `http://localhost:5173/`
  This is the live-reload Docker dev stack using [docker-compose.dev.yml](/Users/samuel/Documents/Techshopmananger/docker-compose.dev.yml). Frontend changes hot-reload through Vite, and backend changes auto-reload through Django `runserver`.

Use the dev stack when you want the old fast local workflow:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Use the production-like stack when you want to test the built app exactly as Docker/Nginx serves it:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```


Built with ❤️ for Nigerian tech repair shop owners.*
